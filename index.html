            <h6>Towards a zero electricity bill</h6>
            <p>Sick of getting big power bills? You've replaced all the old bulbs with LEDs, got a new fridge and super-efficient heat 
                pump and youre still paying around $1200 a year? Your next step is to let HT Green work with you to design and install a 
                system that uses solar, wind or geothermal that's guaranteed to wipe that power bill for now and into the future.</p>

            <h6>Solar PV Solutions</h6>
            <p>Solar Photovoltaic systems have come of age. Installers now can guarantee 
                reliable cost-free power to your home or business. ROI is now taking less time 
                than ever thanks to the ever decreasing equipment costs and better technology. 
                If you have battery storage such as a Tesla Powerwall or similar Lithium Ion  
                chemistry solutions then you can take your savings even further. 
                Call us now to discuss which solution is the best fit for your home.</p>
                
            <h6>Geothermal</h6>
            <p>Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The earth is warmer than 
                the air and we can use this to heat your home. HT Green can engineer a solution 
                to fit your situation to give you free plentiful home warming energy year-round. 
                Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly, but 
                has previously been geographically limited to areas near tectonic plate  
                boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the 
                range and size of viable resources, especially for direct applications such as  
                home heating. 
                Geothermal wells tend to release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the  
                earth, but these emissions are much lower than those of conventional fossil fuels.  
                As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming 
                if widely deployed instead of fossil fuels.</p>

                    and never got around to it but thanks to HT Green's Hydro Oasis  
                    System it was easy! Our creek supplies our total energy needs." </p>
